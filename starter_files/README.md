# Operationalizing Machine Learning

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.

In this project, we use Azure to **configure a cloud-based machine learning production model, deploy it, and consume it**.
We will also create, publish, and consume a pipeline.

## Summary

**Personal information**: Occupation, age, marital status and education.

## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model". 

## Key Steps
1. **Data Preparation**: When autoML run is created, *Bank-Marketing* data is uploaded and registered so that we can use it in our experiments.
